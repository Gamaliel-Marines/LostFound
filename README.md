# 1. Introduction

### Context

I have always dealt with the problem of losing stuff. Since I was a little child I have always forgotten everything thus losing everything. Toys, stuff from school, training kits, etc. I was always scolded for losing my stuff. Now that I’m in college I have lost many things as well.

### What made me do it

The college I go to has a terrible system for the lost and found stuff. It is always difficult to retrieve the things you lose and it’s ever harder and more complex to return the stuff you find and want to give back.

### Solution to a problem

So, I want to change that. I want to create a solution to that problem. I have tried to fix my problem of losing stuff, but it hasn’t worked. So, I’m going to make it easier to retrieve my stuff and help the people who have found them to return them.

# 2. What is the solution

Well, the solution is a software that helps you look for and ask for your stuff, the stuff you have lost. Allows users to upload pictures, descriptions, locations of the objects they have found. Also, facilitates the interaction among the users, so the retrieval of the lost objects becomes easier.

The solution should be available for web, iOS and android. Although understanding the complexity of the project and the time it would require to finish all three. I understand the ambitious nature of the project. Therefore, the primary objective for this project is to complete the web application, then finish the iOS version, and finally the android app.

# 3. Approach and Methodology

Since I’m going to be working on this project while I’m coursing a semester, I will have to work with OKRs (Objective Key Results). This will allow me to have a better control and supervision of the flow of the project, have a better metric corresponding time, and a better notion and understanding of the status of the project.
